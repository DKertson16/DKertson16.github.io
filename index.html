									<p>DinnerPal is a nightly board game aimed at helping young children finish their plates and eat a more diverse diet. I starting DinnerPal alongside two of my good friend Jack and Julia. I wrote the website
										using Django and bootstrap as the main frameworks and used Stripe to handle all payments for the website. Some of the features include a customized user system with in depth account customization, a user 
										referral system using Stripe coupon codes, as well as a page that lets a subscriber choose from a pool of rotating prizes for the kid to enjoy.

									<a href="https://vesc-tool-plotter.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank" class="image fit"><img src="images/vesc_plotter.PNG" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This was written as a part of my senior design project "Electric Hydrofoil + Analysis Software". The goal of this website is to take data from the Electric Hydrofoil that we build and give us an 
										easy way to plot and share the data that it collects. Use the login <strong>admin:password123123</strong> to view some sample data and see how the website works. Django and Bootstrap were the main frameworks 
										used in this project.

									</header>
									<a href="https://jakemortgage.herokuapp.com/portal/loan-details/" target="_blank" class="image fit"><img src="images/note.PNG" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This project is still in its early stages and is more of a proof of concept than anything. As the URL might suggest, this was an idea of my friend Jake who works with loans at his job. 
										We hope to develop and expand this tool into a website where someone can go to pay off their loan, no matter what bank they are with. Follow the website for updates! Website uses Django and Bootstrap.

										<h2><a href="https://github.com/DKertson16/algo-proj" target="_blank">C++ Text Recovery</a></h2>
									</header>
									<p>Written in C++, this program is able to decode an input text file where all spaces have been removed and output a list of possible original documents ranked in order of likelihood.
										 It is able to determine this because of the dictionary.txt file which contains a ranked list of the most used English words and uses a dynamic programming algorithm to do the computation.

									</header>
									<p> Written using typescript/angular, html/css, nodeJS, and Oracle SQL, this webpage allows people with an Santa Clara University account to fill out a survey about their TA.
										 The course instructor uses the site to add students to a class list and the program will automatically email all the students and instruct them to fill out the survey.
										 This is listed under misc because you can't actually access the website without a valid SCU email but you can still view the code on my GitHub.
